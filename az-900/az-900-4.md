# [Part 4: Describe general security and network security features](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-900-describe-general-security-network-security-features/)

### [Protect against security threats on Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/protect-against-security-threats-azure/?ns-enrollment-type=LearningPath&ns-enrollment-id=learn.az-900-describe-general-security-network-security-features)
- Azure Security Center
    - it shows you how secure you are for both your Azure and on-premise services
    - security posture
        - how well can you predict, prevent and respond to threats?
        - what cybersecurity policies and controls do you have in place?
    - Security Center can
        - monitor all your security settings (Azure and on-prem)
        - automatically apply security settings when a resource comes online
        - provide security recommendations
        - automatically identify potential vulnerabilities
        - use ML to detect malware
        - detect potential attacks
        - provide just-in-time network port access
    - dashboard view shows security health, compliance, reports, etc.
    - cloud defense for VMs
        - just-in-time access to VMs
        - control which apps can run on the VMs
        - monitor network traffic
        - monitor changes to important config files
    - you can set up workflows using Azure Logic Apps to respond to security threats
- Azure Sentinel
    - aggregates sources of security info (security information and event management, SIEM)
    - collect data from all users, devices, apps, infrastructure, both on-prem and cloud
    - detect threats using Microsoft's analytics
    - investigate threats with AI
    - respond to threats rapidly
    - connect to
        - Microsoft solution like Microsoft 365, Threat Protection, Azure Active Directory, Windows Defender Firewall
        - AWS CloudTrail, Citrix Analytics, VMWare Carbon Black Cloud, etc.
        - sources that use Common Event Format (CEF) messaging, Syslog or REST
    - you can create custom analyzers to detect threats
    - when an incident occurs, the user can view an investigation graph that shows where/how the incident occurred
    - you can use Azure Monitor Playbooks to automate a response to a threat
- Azure Key Vault
    - store app secrets in one cloud location
    - manage secrets, encryption keys, SSL/TSL certificates or store secrets backed by hardware security modules (HSMs)
    - benefits
        - centralized app secrets
        - securely stored
        - access monitoring and access control
        - simplify administration of secrets
        - integrate easily with other Azure services, like storage accounts, containers, event hubs, etc.
- Azure Dedicated Host
    - host your VMs on a dedicated physical server
    - if you want to be the only Azure customer running on a server, you can get a dedicated server
    - a "dedicated host" is a physical server in an Azure datacenter
    - a "host group" is a collection of dedicated servers
    - benefits
        - helps with compliance requirements if you're required to not share hardware with other customers
        - lets you choose server hardware details, like processors
        - you have more control over the infrastructure than with a regular VM
        - you can also control when maintenance updates occur (within a 35-day window)
    - you pay per dedicated host

### [Secure network connectivity on Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/secure-network-connectivity-azure/?ns-enrollment-type=LearningPath&ns-enrollment-id=learn.az-900-describe-general-security-network-security-features)
- defense in depth: protect information and prevent it from being stolen or accessed by unauthorized people
- layers (outside to inside)
    - physical security
    - identity + access
    - perimeter (protects from DDoS attacks)
    - network
    - compute (access to VMs)
    - application
    - data
- each layer provides protection
- Azure has security tools at each of these layers
- security posture: your ability to protect from and respond to attacks
    - CIA
        - confidentiality: deny access by default and only give permission to people who need it
        - integrity: preventing changes to information when it's at rest and when it's in transit, one-way hashing algs are often used
        - availability: ensure services are available to authorized users and nobody's degrading the systems availability (through a DDoS, for example)
