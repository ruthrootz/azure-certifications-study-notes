# [Part 5: Describe identity, governance, privacy, and compliance features](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-900-describe-identity-governance-privacy-compliance-features/)

### [Secure access to your applications by using Azure identity services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/secure-access-azure-identity-services/?ns-enrollment-type=LearningPath&ns-enrollment-id=learn.az-900-describe-identity-governance-privacy-compliance-features)
- authentication vs. authorization
    - authentication: establishing user's identity, is the user who they say they are
    - authorization: once identity is authenticated, authorization determines what the user gets access to
- Azure Active Directory
    - Active Directory runs on a Windows Server and "syncs" user logins across your services and resources so that each user only has one account associated with them
    - Azure AD takes AD to a new level by being a cloud-based version of AD that syncs your on-prem stuff (apps on intranet, cloud applications) and your Azure and Microsoft resources (Azure, Microsoft 365, etc.)
    - Azure AD provides
        - authentication: verify user's identity
        - single sign-on (SSO): a single identity (login) is linked to a single user
        - application management
        - device management: restrict access attempts to those coming from known devices (so a user can't sign in to just any device)
    - Azure AD Connect syncs your local, existing AD to with Azure AD
    - your Azure AD instance is tied to an Azure AD "tenant" that has users linked to it
- multifactor authentication and conditional access
    - Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication
        - user is prompted for an additional form of identification when signing in
        - three different categories of identifying elements
            - something the user knows: email, password, etc.
            - something the user has: a code sent to their phone, etc.
            - something the user is: a biometric property
        - Azure AD offers multi-factor authentication for the "global admin" access level, but it can be turned on for all users
    - Conditional Access
        - Azure AD can be used to allow/deny access based on the user's identity, location and device
        - you can conditionally turn on multi-factor authentication based on these things as well
        - you need an Azure AD Premium P1 or P2 license or a Microsoft 365 Business Premium license to use Conditional Access

### [Build a cloud governance strategy on Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/build-cloud-governance-strategy-azure/?ns-enrollment-type=LearningPath&ns-enrollment-id=learn.az-900-describe-identity-governance-privacy-compliance-features)
- governance: establishing rules and policies and making sure they are adhered to
    - it helps you make sure you stay compliant with industry standards (like PCI DSS) and corporate standards, like security requirements
- role-based access control (Azure RBAC)
    - you can create roles or use Azure's built-in roles that define a set of permissions
    - then you assign users or groups to one or more of these roles
    - ![role-based access](role-scope.png)
        - each column is a role (custom or built-in)
        - each row is a scope
        - each user or user group can be assigned multiple roles that span multiple scopes
    - when you assign a role to a user you also select a scope
        - management group (collection of subscriptions)
        - single subscription
        - resource group
        - single resource
    - every action that gets passed through Azure Resource Manager will verify that the user has permission to make the action
- resource locks
    - a resource lock prevents authorized users from making changes or from deleting a resource
    - there are two levels of lock: CanNotDelete and ReadOnly
    - entities that can have a lock: subscriptions, resource groups, resources
    - a lock can be added/deleted from the entity's Settings -> Locks page
    - if you have an Azure Blueprint it can replace locks on specific entities in case the lock gets deleted
- organize resources with tags
    - ways to organize resources: group them into subscriptions, put related resources into resource groups, add metadata tags to the resources
    - resource tags let you
        - find resources based on specific workloads, environments, business units and owners
        - group resources and generate cost reports and estimates
        - group tags into how critical their availability is
        - classify resources by security level
        - identify which resources are compliant with which regulations
        - perform automated tasks on resources based on their tags
    - you can use Azure Policy to enforce rules about tags, such as requiring tags to be applied to new resources or making resources inherit tags from their resource group, etc.
- Azure Policy
    - Azure Policy lets you define rules/policies that control you resources
    - you can get Policy to
        - prevent locks from being removed from certain resources
        - require that certain tags be applied to certain resources
        - reapply locks, tags, etc. if they get removed
        - prevent non-compliant resources from being created
        - highlight non-compliant resources
        - apply policies to DevOps pre- or post-deployment phases
        - example: require MFA for all subscription accounts with write permissions
        - example: require system updates (which are recommended through Azure Security Center)
    - a group of policies is called an initiative
    - Azure has a bunch of built-in policies you can use
    - when you create a policy you're defining what to evaluate and what action to take
    - when you apply a policy, you apply it to a specific scope (see scopes listed above), and all the subscopes automatically get the policy applied
    - policies are evaluated about once per hour
    - Azure Policy initiatives
        - it's a way of grouping policies together
        - example: a group of policies that check for notifications from Azure Security Center regarding the resources the initiative is applied to
- Azure Blueprints
    - it allows you to define a set of governance tools and standard resources at the subscription level
    - things Azure Blueprints orchestrate
        - role assignments
        - policy assignments
        - Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates
        - resource groups
    - blueprints are versioned
    - each component in a blueprint is called an artifact
        - some artifacts require configuration while some are ready to go right away
- Cloud Adoption Framework
    - it's a step-by-step guide for implementing your cloud infrastructure
    - each stage has exercises and tools for you to work with
    - stages:
        - ![framework stages](framework-stages.png)
- create a subscription governance strategy
    - things to consider when setting up subscriptions for your Azure cloud
        - decide how to split up subscriptions based on billing practices (by department maybe?)
        - each subscription has an Azure Active Directory tenant, which provides admins with the ability to define and assign roles
        - consider resource limits (e.g. you can only have up to 10 Azure ExpressRoute circuits per subscription)

    - it is a fully owned subsidiary of 21Vianet
    - China has special/extra regulations that IaaS and PaaS companies have to follow
    - the service also has to have less than 50% foreign investment, which is why Azure China 21Vianet is owned by a Chinese company
    - Azure China 21Vianet supports most of the services that global Azure does
