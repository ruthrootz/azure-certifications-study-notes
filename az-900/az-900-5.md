# [Part 5: Describe identity, governance, privacy, and compliance features](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-900-describe-identity-governance-privacy-compliance-features/)

### [Secure access to your applications by using Azure identity services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/secure-access-azure-identity-services/?ns-enrollment-type=LearningPath&ns-enrollment-id=learn.az-900-describe-identity-governance-privacy-compliance-features)
- authentication vs. authorization
    - authentication: establishing user's identity, is the user who they say they are
    - authorization: once identity is authenticated, authorization determines what the user gets access to
- Azure Active Directory
    - Active Directory runs on a Windows Server and "syncs" user logins across your services and resources so that each user only has one account associated with them
    - Azure AD takes AD to a new level by being a cloud-based version of AD that syncs your on-prem stuff (apps on intranet, cloud applications) and your Azure and Microsoft resources (Azure, Microsoft 365, etc.)
    - Azure AD provides
        - authentication: verify user's identity
        - single sign-on (SSO): a single identity (login) is linked to a single user
        - application management
        - device management: restrict access attempts to those coming from known devices (so a user can't sign in to just any device)
    - Azure AD Connect syncs your local, existing AD to with Azure AD
    - your Azure AD instance is tied to an Azure AD "tenant" that has users linked to it
- multifactor authentication and conditional access
    - Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication
        - user is prompted for an additional form of identification when signing in
        - three different categories of identifying elements
            - something the user knows: email, password, etc.
            - something the user has: a code sent to their phone, etc.
            - something the user is: a biometric property
        - Azure AD offers multi-factor authentication for the "global admin" access level, but it can be turned on for all users
    - Conditional Access
        - Azure AD can be used to allow/deny access based on the user's identity, location and device
        - you can conditionally turn on multi-factor authentication based on these things as well
        - you need an Azure AD Premium P1 or P2 license or a Microsoft 365 Business Premium license to use Conditional Access
