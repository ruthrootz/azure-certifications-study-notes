# [Part 5: Describe identity, governance, privacy, and compliance features](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-900-describe-identity-governance-privacy-compliance-features/)

### [Secure access to your applications by using Azure identity services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/secure-access-azure-identity-services/?ns-enrollment-type=LearningPath&ns-enrollment-id=learn.az-900-describe-identity-governance-privacy-compliance-features)
- authentication vs. authorization
    - authentication: establishing user's identity, is the user who they say they are
    - authorization: once identity is authenticated, authorization determines what the user gets access to
- Azure Active Directory
    - Active Directory runs on a Windows Server and "syncs" user logins across your services and resources so that each user only has one account associated with them
    - Azure AD takes AD to a new level by being a remotely-hosted version of AD that syncs your on-prem stuff (apps on intranet, cloud applications) and your Azure and Microsoft resources (Azure, Microsoft 365, etc.)
    - Azure AD provides
        - authentication: verify user's identity
        - single sign-on (SSO): a single identity (login) is linked to a single user
        - application management
        - device management: restrict access attempts to those coming from known devices (so a user can't sign in to just any device)
    - Azure AD Connect syncs your local, existing AD to with Azure AD
- multifactor authentication and conditional access
