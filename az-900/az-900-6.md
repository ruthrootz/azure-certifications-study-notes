# [Part 6: Describe Azure cost management and service level agreements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-900-describe-azure-cost-management-service-level-agreements/)

### [Plan and manage your Azure costs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/plan-manage-azure-costs/?ns-enrollment-type=LearningPath&ns-enrollment-id=learn.az-900-describe-azure-cost-management-service-level-agreements)
- Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator
    - it's an Azure service that estimates the cost difference between running on Azure vs. on-premise
    - categories of workloads to count in cost: servers, databases, storage, networking
    - add in: cost for electricity, IT labor cost, maintenance costs
- purchasing Azure services
    - subscription types
        - free
        - pay-as-you-go
        - member offers (possible Azure services available through other Microsoft subscriptions you might have)
    - how to purchase services
        - through an enterprise agreement (for larger customers)
        - through Azure's website itself
        - through a cloud solution provider that you work with that uses Azure
    - factors that affect cost
        - different resources have different costs, and even different versions of the same resource
        - how much the resource is used (CPU time, time spent with public IP address, incoming and outgoing network traffic, disk size and number of read/write operations
        - things you buy off of Azure Marketplace
        - what region a resource is in
        - support option you choose
    - Auzre's Pricing Calculator can help aggregate these costs and give an estimate
- manage and minimize total cost on Azure
    - understand your estimated costs before deploying (use TCO Calculator)
    - Azure Advisor is a platform that monitors your usage and shows you resources that you aren't using much and that can save you money if canceled
    - set spending limits
    - use Azure Reservations; you pay in advance and get up to 72% off
    - choose low-cost regions for your resources
    - use Azure Cost Management + Billing; it shows you where all your different costs are coming from; you can create reports and budgets from this dashboard and also get recommendations and alerts
    - resize underused VMs
    - deallocate VMs during off hours
    - delete unused resources
    - gradually move from IaaS to PaaS services; you get less control with a PaaS service but it's cheaper

### [Choose the right Azure services by examining SLAs and service lifecycle](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/choose-azure-services-sla-lifecycle/?ns-enrollment-type=LearningPath&ns-enrollment-id=learn.az-900-describe-azure-cost-management-service-level-agreements)
- service-level agreement (SLA)
    - and SLA is a formal agreement between the service company (in this case, Azure) and the customer about the services being provided
    - an SLA with Azure will specify the performance and availability that Azure commits to providing its customer
    - you can view Azure's SLAs for various services from the Service Level Agreements page
    - performance commitments are typically measured as a percentage and represent the amount of uptime Azure commits to providing
        - SLA percentages and their corresponding downtime
            - 99 -> 1.68 hours/week
            - 99.99 -> 1.01 minutes/week
            - 99.999 -> 6 seconds/week
        - customers get service credits for experiencing downtime
    - free services usually don't have an SLA; you typically need to file a claim to get credit
- define your application SLA
    - start with deciding how important each of your applications is to your company
    - sort your applications by business impact
    - consider each app's effect on other business operations
    - define the usage patters for each of your apps (when/how users use the app)
    - lastly, set a realistic percentage you can commit to
- design your application to meet your SLA
    - identify your workloads (VMs, SQL DBs, load balancer, etc.)
    - compute a composite SLA percentage based on all the workloads (by multiplying the percentages together)
    - if you can't meet your SLA with your current workloads
        - consider upgrading individual resources
        - consider upgrading your Azure tier
        - deploy copies of VMs across different zones in the same region
        - deploy across multiple regions for redundancy
    - SLA percentages above 99.99 are almost never achievable
