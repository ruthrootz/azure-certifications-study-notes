# [Part 3: Describe core solutions and management tools on Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-900-describe-core-solutions-management-tools-azure/)

### [Choose the best Azure IoT service for your application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/iot-fundamentals/?ns-enrollment-type=LearningPath&ns-enrollment-id=learn.az-900-describe-core-solutions-management-tools-azure)
- managing IoT devices with Azure
    - common measuring devices
        - weather info
        - bar codes, QR codes
        - geolocation
        - light, radar, ladar
        - sound, motion, smell
        - chemical sensors (smoke, gas, alcohol)
        - pressure
        - error detection
    - IoT devices such as ones that measure the above can collect data and send it to Azure
    - that aggregate data can be stored and processed by Azure services
        - you can predict when you'll need to do maintenance
        - you can know when you have to increase inventory
    - you can send updates to devices through Azure
    - Azure IoT Hub
        - two-way communication with your IoT devices
        - secure connections to millions of devices
        - mostly for transferring data
    - Azure IoT Central
        - like Hub but also offers a customizable dashboard
        - you can set up alerts to trigger when certain things happen to the devices
        - has monitoring and reporting capabilities that Hub doesn't
    - Azure Sphere
        - end-to-end security, from the device to Azure
        - comes with physical micro-controller unit
        - has built-in Linux OS to run security software
        - can detect if it's been compromised (Azure Sphere Security Service)
        - the device will only connect to Azure if the MCU decides it's safe
 - analyze decision criteria (how to choose which IoT service to use)
    - is it likely that devices get hacked and is it critical that they don't? (Azure Sphere)
    - do I need a dashboard to manage and report data? (Azure Central adds a dashboard on top of Azure Hub)
    - do I just need the data because I already have my own software to use the data? (Azure Hub)

### [Choose the best AI service for your needs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/ai-machine-learning-fundamentals/?ns-enrollment-type=LearningPath&ns-enrollment-id=learn.az-900-describe-core-solutions-management-tools-azure)
- product options
    - deep learning algorithm: algorithm that is structured like the human brain, with neurons, enabling it to grow and learn from data
    - machine learning algorithm: data model is trained with data and then used to predict results for new data
    - Azure Machine Learning
        - set up process for obtaining, cleaning and splitting data
        - train and evaluate models
        - define where and when training should occur (since it's computationally intensive and shouldn't be run anywhere, anytime)
        - deploy the best algorithms for use
    - Azure Cognitive Services
        - you don't need to know about machine learning to use this service
        - provides prebuilt ML models
        - they solve general problems with
            - language
            - speech
            - vision
            - decision-making
    - Azure Bot Service
        - for creating a bot that acts like a human
        - meant to automate simple or repetitive tasks
- analyze the decision criteria
    - are you building a virtual agent to interface with humans using natural language?
        - use Bot Service
        - there are pre-built Bots on Azure Marketplace
    - do you need a service to understand media such as text, sound, images, etc?
        - Cognitive Services will solve common problems that have already been solved with ML
        - it works with common media data types (text, video, speech, images, etc.)
    - do you need to make predictions or provide personalized recommendations?
        - Cognitive Services has a Personalizer component to do this
        - you could also train your own models with Azure ML Service
    - do you have custom/personal data you want to make predictions with?
        - you can use Azure ML Service to create, test and deploy your own models

### [Choose the best Azure serverless technology for your business scenario](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/serverless-fundamentals/?ns-enrollment-type=LearningPath&ns-enrollment-id=learn.az-900-describe-core-solutions-management-tools-azure)
- serverless computing: an execution environment that's set up and managed for you

### [Choose the best tools to help organizations build better solutions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/azure-devops-devtest-labs/?ns-enrollment-type=LearningPath&ns-enrollment-id=learn.az-900-describe-core-solutions-management-tools-azure)

### [Choose the best tools for managing and configuring your Azure environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/management-fundamentals/?ns-enrollment-type=LearningPath&ns-enrollment-id=learn.az-900-describe-core-solutions-management-tools-azure)

### [Choose the best monitoring service for visibility, insight, and outage mitigation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/monitoring-fundamentals/?ns-enrollment-type=LearningPath&ns-enrollment-id=learn.az-900-describe-core-solutions-management-tools-azure)
