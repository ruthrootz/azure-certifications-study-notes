# [Part 3: Describe core solutions and management tools on Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-900-describe-core-solutions-management-tools-azure/)

### [Choose the best Azure IoT service for your application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/iot-fundamentals/?ns-enrollment-type=LearningPath&ns-enrollment-id=learn.az-900-describe-core-solutions-management-tools-azure)
- common measuring devices
    - weather info
    - bar codes, QR codes
    - geo-location
    - light, radar, ladar
    - sound, motion, smell
    - chemical sensors (smoke, gas, alcohol)
    - pressure
    - error detection
- IoT devices such as ones that measure the above can collect data and send it to Azure
- that aggragate data can be stored and processed by Azure services
    - you can predict when you'll need to do maintencance
    - you can know when you have to increase inventory
- you can send updates to devices through Azure
- Azure IoT Hub
    - two-way communication with your IoT devices
    - secure connections to millions of devices
    - mostly for transfering data
- Azure IoT Central
    - like Hub but also offers a customizable dashboard
    - you can set up alerts to trigger when certain things happen to the devices
    - has monitoring and reporting capabilites that Hub doesn't
- Azure Sphere
    - end-to-end security, from the device to Azure
    - comes with physical micro-controller unit
    - has buit-in Linuz OS to run security software
    - can detect if it's been comprimized (Azure Sphere Security Service)
    - the device will only connect to Azure if the MCU decides it's safe
 - analyze decision criteria
