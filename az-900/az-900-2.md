- most prominent Azure compute services
    - VMs
        - IaaS
        - simulate computers with an OS already installed
        - they are at the IaaS level
        - everything but the hardware is customizable
        - VM scale sets: a set of identical, load-balanced VMs
    - container instances
        - you can run multiple on a single VM
        - they are virtualized application environments that are set up to run a specific app
        - they are designed to quickly replicate settings for multiple app instances
    - app services
        - PaaS
        - the platform that the app is running on is managed for you
    - Azure functions (for serverless computing)
        - if you just want your code to run, make it an Azure function
        - you don't care about the underlying platform of infrastructure
- when to use VMs
    - custom hosting configurations
    - custom software running on VM
    - you need to update, configure and maintain the software running on the VM
    - you can select a preconfigured VM image
    - examples of when to use VMs
        - use for testing your app on different OSs
        - when running applications on VMs you can easily add/remove VMs as demand increases/decreases
        - when extending an on-premise network
        - during disaster recovery you can use VMs to pick up the slack
    - lift and shift: the process of moving from a physical server to the cloud
        - you can just make an image of the existing server and run that image on a VM
    - Azure batch
        - this is for running large-scale parallel and high-performance computing jobs
        - batch will spin up a pool of VMs, install the necessary apps and data, runs the jobs and then scales down as the work completes
- when to use an app service
- when to use a container/Kubernetes service
- when to use an Azure function
- when to use a virtual desktop
