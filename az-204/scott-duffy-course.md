### virtual machines
- Azure spot instance: you get to rent for cheap a VM for a short time (less than a day)
- after choosing options for the VM you can save those settings as an ARM template
- resources created with a VM
    - VM itself
    - public IP address
    - virtual network card
    - network security group
    - virtual network (in the same region as the VM)
    - virtual disk/s
    - optional resources
        - automatic shutdown rule
        - etc.
- ARM templates
    - creating a VM from an ARM template gives you a form with inputs for the parameters in the template script
    - you can save the parameters JSON file from a deployed VM and import the JSON into the template form
    - admin user password doesn't get saved/imported as a parameter

### Azure App Service
- a web app lives inside an app service plan
- ACU: Azure compute unit
- WebJobs
    - a background task that is attached to a web app
    - it runs on a schedule
    - kind of like a timer-triggered Azure Function
- deployment slots
    - a way to host multiple instances of an app all under one web app instance
- CLI hint: use `get-command *{search term}*` to search for a command
- Kudu
    - when you publish your web app, you get a URL for the Kudu site of your app
    - the Kudu site gives you details about your app
        - files
        - log streams
        - deployment scripts
    - from the site you can use a cloud Bash or PowerShell shell to navigate the directories

### containers
- Azure offers different container options
    - you can pick to deploy your web app to a Docker container when you create the app resource
    - you can create a Kubernetes resource, which is complex to set up and use, but it's powerful and scales well
    - you can create an Azure container instance, which is a simple and fast way to get a container running, but it's not as powerful as Kubernetes and it doesn't scale
- you can build your web app project into an image and push it to a directory right from VS
- you can then deploy those images to an Azure web app, a VM with Docker running on it, an Azure Container Instance, etc.
- Docker image: a bundle of OS, dependencies and code that can be used to create and run a container instance
- Azure Container Registry
    - a place to publish private container images
    - DockerHub, on the other hand, is a public registry
    - a container registry is a resource
- Azure Container Instance
    - a container instance is a resource in which a deployed container image runs
    - ACI is faster to deploy than an app service, but app services have more features (backups, scaling, etc.)

### Function App
- Durable Functions
    - stateful
    - long-running tasks (more than 30min)
    - can be suspended while it waits for another call to complete
    - can call other functions
    - can make async calls
    - made up of
        - client: the original function that gets triggered, generally starts the orchestrator
        - orchestrator: the traffic cop, makes sure the activities run in the right order
        - activity: basic unit of work in a function
- how to set up durable functions
    - create an app service plan
    - go to App Service Editor
    - create a package.json file in the app service root
    - add app name and version to the file
    - use npm to install durable functions package
        - `npm install durable-functions`
    - you can now create a function based on the durable function starter template
    - then create a function based on the durable function orchestrator template
        - it references the activity functions
    - then create functions for each activity, based on the durable function activity template
    - test the durable function by calling the starter/client function
        - it returns several URLs that can give you back different information about the durable function and its state
- delays and timers
    - install TypeScript and Moment from the App Service Plan's console
    - add `const moment = require('moment');` to the orchestrator function
    - `deadline = moment.utc(context.df.currentUtcDateTime).add(1, 'h');`
    - `yield context.df.createTimer(deadline.toDate());`
    - `outputs.push(yield context.df.callActivity('ActivityFunctionName', 'parameter/s'));`
- Function Core Tools - func
    - you can create functions in the cloud shell
    - `func init` + `func new` and then `code .` to open a code editor
    - `func start` runs the function on localhost in the cloud shell
    -  then you can `az functionapp create` to create a function app
    - `func azure functionapp publish "name of function app"` to publish the function to a function app
- custom handlers
    - use programming languages that aren't traditionally supported by Azure function apps
    - choose "Custom Handler" for runtime stack on the create function app screen
    - you have to develop the app in a code editor that supports your language
    - in host.json you
        - set the `customHandler.description/defaultExecutablePath` to `handler` (or `handler.exe` for Windows)
        - set `customHandler/enableForwardingHttpRequest` to `true`
        - the handler will be the complied function code

### Azure storage accounts
- managed storage accounts are the accounts Azure makes when you create a VM, open the cloud shell for the first time, etc., you don't create them directly
- unmanaged storage accounts are the ones you create as resources for whatever you want
    - premium performance tier
        - you pay more per GB of storage but less for the transactions themselves
        - used for data you're accessing hundreds of times a second
    - in the networking tab, when creating a storage account, you can choose
        - access the account through a public endpoint
            - you'd still need a private access key to hit the endpoint
        - access the account through a specific network, and then you pick/create a virtual network
        - a private endpoint cannot be accessed from the internet, even with an access key or via VPN
    - blob containers
        - types of containers
            - private: no anonymous read access
            - blob: anonymous read access for all the blobs
            - container: anonymous read access for entire container
    - accessing data from storage account
        - under the storage account's properties, there is a URL for each of the container types (blob, file, queue, table, Data Lake, static website)
            - if you have read-only geo-redundant storage enabled, you get a secondary endpoint for each type as well
        - under access keys you will find the access keys that enable full access to the entire account
            - hitting the endpoint for a file/account/container with the key will serve you the file/account/container
        - under shared access signature (SAS) you can select permissions and a time duration that the files/containers can be accesses and then generate a token that can be appended to the endpoint URLs

### CosmosDB
- no-SQL, non-relational DB
- Cosmos guarantees sub 10ms latency
- it is more expensive than an Azure Table Storage
- types of CosmosDB accounts
    - Core (SQL)
        - JSON documents stored
        - you can use SQL to access the data
    - MongoDB
        - usually used for migrating an existing DB
    - Cassandra
        - also usually used for migrating
    - Azure Table
        - different from a table in an Azure storage account
    - Gremlin (Graph)
        - based on nodes, edges/relations
- you can make the CosmosDB account geo-redundant (which means you'll be paying double for storage)
- if you pick geo-redundant storage you can enable the paired region to make writes to the account (doubles the cost of the account again)
- two copies of DB backups are stored for you for free
    - you can then choose between locally- or geo-redundant storage
- once you have an account
    - you can create containers and explore them through the Data Explorer
    - you can create role-based access controls
    - you can add/remove read regions on the replicate page
        - the synchronizing and replication happens automatically
    - on the keys page you can view your primary and secondary access keys, both the read-write and the read keys, as well as the URI for the account
- creating a container
    - you get to pick an RU/second level (400+)
    - 1 RU/s: the amount of compute needed to read 1kb of data in one second
    - the higher the RU, the more the DB will cost you
    - you can choose to share those RU/s across all the containers in your DB
    - partition key: the field by which CosmosDB will physically split up your data
- default consistency (how the data syncs across replicated regions)
    - strong: data is automatically synced each time it changes
    - bounded stateless: you set the maximum amount of time you will allow before data has to be synced
    - session: this is the default, the clients in the current session will see their data synced across whatever regions they're accessing, but for regions that aren't being currently accessed there are undefined delays between syncs
    - consistent prefix: no guarantee of when the data gets synced, but it'll always be in the right order
    - eventual: no guarantee of when the data gets synced and no guarantee of order

### SQL database
- SQL Server resource
    - the simplest way to migrate your existing DBs is to create a
    - not cheapest
    - you'd essentially have a VM running what you used to have hosted on your own machines
    - used if you need to really fine-tune the DBs and/or manage CPU precisely
- Azure SQL Server resource
    - also a simple option if you have basic DBs
    - migrate data and change connection strings, that's it
    - cheaper
    - usually the best option
    - PaaS
    - you pay per DB
    - there are also MariaDB, MySQL and PostgreSQL options
    - elastic pool
        - you can have multiple DBs sharing the same compute resources
        - good if the DBs are independent and they won't both get flooded with traffic at the same time
    - DTU: data transaction unit, a combo of CPU and memory resources
        - you are charged per DTU
        - the charge per DTU is different depending on the pricing tier you choose
        - performance models: Basic, Standard, Premium
    - there is now also a vCore model that is used instead of the DTU model
        - you get to pick
            - General Purpose, Hyperscale and Business Critical pricing tiers
            - provisioned / serverless
                - serverless scales up or down automatically
                - you can't predict your cost in advance
            - how many cores you want
            - how much memory you want
        - much more expensive than the DTU model
    - when you create a DB you're also creating a server (unless you specified an existing server to put the DB on)
    - you can set up Active Directory access
    - you add IPs to the firewall rules of the server to access the DB/s
    - geo replication
        - you can replicate your data in multiple regions
        - each time, you create a new server
        - read-only
        - you pay double what you did if you only have the DB on your primary server
- Azure SQL Managed Instance
    - Azure manages performance and scaling for you
- SQL Data Warehouse
    - used for tons of data
    - used for reporting

### blob containers
- container into which you can put whatever files you want
- access levels
    - private: no anonymous access
    - blob: anonymous read access to blobs only
    - container: anonymous read access to all containers and blobs
- to access a blob/container you still need an access key (I think)
- AzCopy
    - a Windows command line tool
    - you can use it to move files between containers, etc.
    - if you're moving between storage accounts you're going to have different `/SourceKey` and `/DestinationKey` arguments
- leases
    - different clients can "lease" a file while they use it, and that locks out all other users
    - once the client is done with the file, they break the lease so that another client can access it
- access tiers
    - hot: the default, it's cheap to access, expensive to store
    - cool: stored for at least 30 days
    - archive: stored for at least 180 days, cheap to store, expensive to access

### Azure authentication
- Azure Active Directory
    - different than Windows AD
    - you can connect on-prem (Windows AD) with Azure AD
    - if you're connected to Windows AD, you don't have to sync all your Azure AD accounts, i.e. the syncing can go only one way (Windows -> Azure)
    - you can allow users to log in with Google/Facebook/Microsoft
    - you can create an Azure AD account with your own domain (instead of the default Microsoft domain)
    - AD has built-in multi-factor authentication (you enable per account)
- Azure tenant
    - when you create a new account, it creates a completely new Azure tenant, without resources or even a subscription
    - you can hook the tenant up to an app and use the tenant to authenticate and register the app's users
    - once you register your app on the AD account, you get a client ID to put into your app
    - then you activate tokens for the application (under Authentication)
    - your app sends a request to your AD account and the AD account sends back a token to the redirect URI that you specify in the AD account application
    - you can create users for individual apps in your AD account

### Azure Access Control
- RBAC (role based access control)
    - give users access only to what they need
    - access is based on type + role + scope
    - roles
        - owner: access to everything and can grant access to other users
        - contributor: access to everything but can't grant access to others
        - reader: read-only
        - and tons more, specific to types of resources
        - and custom roles
    - scopes
        - resource
        - resource group
        - subscription
        - management group
- SAS (shared access signature)
    - used instead of making AD accounts for every single user who needs to access your resources
    - access keys allow users with that key to access the resource / resource group / etc.
    - shared access signatures allow you to assign much more granular permissions
    - the user would use the combination of access key and SAS to access the resource/etc.
    - you can revoke SAS tokens, but you can regenerate access keys

### secure data
- storage accounts
    - encryption at rest
        - this is turned on by default
        - you can't turn encryption off
        - but you can use your own encryption key
            - you store them in your Key Vault
    - encryption in transit
        - in configuration you must enable secure transfer required
            - this is for HTTPS/SSL option
            - it doesn't support secure transfer for custom domain names
        - you then use your encryption key for transfers from/to the app that uses that storage account
- Azure DBs
    - transparent data encryption page
        - data is automatically encrypted at rest
        - you can't turn server encryption off
        - like with storage accounts you can choose to use your own key
    - you can encrypt at server and DB levels
        - you can turn off encryption for individual DBs
    - the master DB can't be encrypted because that's the DB that stores the keys
- Azure key vaults page
    - you can restrict access to a key vault to only specific virtual networks
    - used to store
        - keys: encryption keys
        - secrets: for values you don't want hard-coded in your config file
            - kind of like environment variables except env vars are usually used once per build and not reused during a runtime
            - secrets have URLs
            - ARM templates often access secrets, not just apps/APIs
        - certificates: used for HTTPS and SSL certificates

### scaling apps and services
- free plan and basic plan don't offer autoscaling
- manual scaling
    - scale up: moving between plan tiers for an app service
    - scale out: increase number of instances of the app
- automatic scaling
    - available on the standard plan and up
    - standard plan can scale out to up to 10 instances
    - when you enable autoscaling
        - you define scaling conditions / rules
        - you pick the metric source you want to monitor
        - the specific metric
        - the threshold
        - and the resulting action
    - you can set the min, max and default number of instances
    - you should have a scale in and scale out rule for each condition
    - you can have multiple scale conditions (that track different metrics)
- VM scale sets
    - group of identical VMs
    - you can set up scaling rules like you can for app services
    - you don't spend more for using scale sets, but you do pay per instance
- the difference between availability sets and scale sets
    - scale sets are identical VMs
    - availability sets are individual VMs that share resources
- single VM scaling
    - under VM size page, you can resize the VM
- load balancing
    - you can create a load balancer and add availability sets to it
- you can set up an ARM template that runs a script based on different VM metrics
- transient faults
    - most of the time, scaling up doesn't affect users
    - scaling down does, because what if the cloud app is trying to scale down while an execution is happening?
    - that's called a transient fault
    - you should implement retry or back-off policies to handle failed requests
    - you could use a queue or DB to receive requests and then let it deal with failures instead of making the app making the request make the retry requests
    - this uncouples the requesting API/app/server and the receiving API/app/server since neither has to directly talk to the other
    - if an error happens over and over, you should have a special queue/log to alert someone so it can be dealt with

### caching and content delivery networks
- Redis
    - Redis is a very fast cache
    - it's an in-memory DB
    - you use the StackExchange.Redis package
    - you use the connection string from your Redis Azure resource
- CDN (content delivery network)
    - stores the static content from your app on a server that's not your web server
    - stores the data closer to the client
    - create a CDN
        - create a CDN profile
            - a CDN is a global service, you don't pick a region for it
            - three companies offer CDN services on Azure
                - Verizon / Verizon Premium
                - Microsoft
                - Akamai
            - all the companies charge the same amount
        - create a CDN endpoint
            - this is the URL that your app will use to access the files
            - the app will hit those endpoints, and if it doesn't find the content it'll request it from your server and store it in the cache for next time
            - each time your static files get updated you have to purge the caches
            - or you can version your files and specify the correct version in your app, forcing the clients to get the new version from the server and cache it instead of using the old file that was already cached

### monitoring and logging
- Azure Monitor
    - central spot that puts together the logs/diagnostics from all your resources
    - you can view
        - logs: shows logs for resources that have logging turned on
            - logs have to be enabled on each resource
            - logs are different from metrics and diagnostic settings
            - you have to choose an Analytics Workspace to save the logs to
        - alerts
        - metrics: builds traffic/performance graphs, allows you to turn on alerts
        - service health
    - insights section
        - you can view information by type of resource (VMs, apps, containers, etc.)
    - under Diagnostic settings you can see all the resources you can enable logging on
- logging for VMs
    - you have to enable monitoring
    - and choose what to performance counter to monitor and what logs to collect
    - you could choose to send the diagnostic data to Application Insights
    - you can configure the Azure Diagnostics agent (where the logs are stored, disk quota, etc.)
- logging for Function Apps
    - you can enable Azure Insights from the monitor section of the app

### consuming Azure services
- Logic App
    - it's essentailly a workflow
    - it's point-and-click and visual
    - you can pick from tons of templates
    - it's an if-this-then-that service
    - trigger: HTTP request, file is added to a server, when a tweet is posted
    - action: run an Azure Function App, upload a file, make an HTTP request, write to a DB, condition, etc.
- Azure Search
    - allows you to add in-app search
    - different tiers offer you different sizes and number of indexes
    - higher tiers offer
        - more storage
        - scaling instances
        - partitions
        - replicas
        - load balancing
- API Management
    - 
- Swagger / OpenAPI
- Event Grid / Event Hub

### application messaging
